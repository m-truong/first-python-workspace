# A best practice among Python developers is to use a project-specific virtual environment.
# Once you activate that environment, any packages you then install are isolated from other environments, including the global interpreter environment.
# ... ^^^ this reduces many complications that can arise from conflicting package versions.
# use Venv or Anaconda with Python: Create Environment.
# Note: By using the .py file extension, you tell VS Code to interpret this file as a Python program, so that it evaluates the contents with the Python extension and the selected interpreter.
